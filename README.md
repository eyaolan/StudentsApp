# Bigcommerce Sample App: Ruby
This is a small Sinatra application that implements the OAuth callback flow for BigCommerce [Single Click Apps][single_click_apps]
and uses the [BigCommerce API][api_client] to pull a list of products on a BigcCommerce store. For information on how to develop apps
for BigCommerce stores, see our [Developer Portal][devdocs].

We hope this sample app gives you a good starting point for building your next killer app! What follows are steps specific
to running and installing this sample appication.

### Registering the app with BigCommerce
* Create a trial store on [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/)
* Go to the [Developer Portal][devdocs] and click "My Apps".
* Login to your account.
* Click the button "Create an app", enter a name for the new app, and then click "Create"
* You don't have to fill out all the details for your app right away, but you do need
to provide some core details in section 4 (Technical). Note that if you are just getting
started, you can use `localhost` for your hostname, but ultimately you'll need to host your
app on the public Internet.
  * _Auth Callback URL_: `https://<app hostname>/auth/bigcommerce/callback`
  * _Load Callback URL_: `https://<app hostname>/load`
  * _Uninstall Callback URL_: `https://<app hostname>/uninstall`
* Enable the _Products - Modify_ scope under _OAuth scopes_. This sample app uses that scope, but if you need others,
you'll need to specify them here and then modify the `scopes` method in `hello.rb` to match.
* Click `Save & Close` on the top right of the dialog.
* You'll now see your app in a list in the _My Apps_ section of Develper Portal. Hover over it and click
_View Client ID_. You'll need these values in the next step.

### Getting started
* Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra.git`
* Change to the repo directory: `cd hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra`
* Install gems: `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
* Copy `.env-example` to `.env`
* Edit `.env`:
  * Set `BC_CLIENT_ID` and `BC_CLIENT_SECRET` to the values obtained from Developer Portal.
  * Set `APP_URL` to `https://<app hostname>`
  * Set `SESSION_SECRET` to a long random string, such as that generated by `ruby -e "require 'securerandom'; puts SecureRandom.hex(64)"`
* Run the app: `foreman start`

### Hosting the app
In order to install this app in a BigCommerce store, it must be hosted on the public Internet. You can get started in development
by simply running `foreman start` to run it locally, and then use `localhost` in your URLs, but ultimately you will need to host
it somewhere to use the app anywhere other than your development system. One easy option is to put it on Heroku.

### Getting started (Heroku version)
1. Click this button: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
2. Fill in the details from the app portal on the Heroku deployment page
  * See [Registering the app with BigCommerce](#registering-the-app-with-bigcommerce) above. Ignore the callback URLs, just save the app to get the Client ID and Client Secret.
3. Deploy the app, and click "view" when it's done
4. Take the callback URLs from the instructions page and plug them into the dev portal. All done!

### Installing the app in your trial store
* Login to your trial store
* Go to the Marketplace and click _My Drafts_. Find the app you just created and click it.
* A details dialog will open. Click _Install_ and the draft app will be installed in your store.
